# Crowd Monitoring System
![Main](Logo/page1.png)
This study intends to monitor the individuals using CNN (Convolutional Neural Network) algorithm which functions as a neural network with one or more convolutional layers that is mostly used for processing images, classifying data, segmenting data, and other autocorrelated data.
## Overview
To train the custom dataset and utilize camera-based people and crowd detection, this application uses [YOLO Algorithm](https://www.section.io/engineering-education/introduction-to-yolo-algorithm-for-object-detection/). This app operates in real-time.
